# Building Effective Agents: LangGraph and CrewAI Implementations

This repository contains two Google Colab notebooks demonstrating agent design patterns from "Building Effective Agents" using LangGraph and CrewAI frameworks.

## Notebooks

1. **LangGraph Agent Patterns with LangSmith Tracing**
   - Demonstrates prompt chaining, tool augmentation, and multi-agent collaboration.
   - Integrates LangSmith Studio for tracing and debugging.

2. **CrewAI Agent Patterns**
   - Implements role-based agents with specific goals and backstories.
   - Showcases task orchestration and collaborative workflows.
